= Introduction
Blockchain has revolutionized the technological landscape of digital application for its decentralized nature. This decentralized nature is primarily enabled by its transparency and trustless foundation - by being the trust machine itself @Tripathi_et-al_2023 @Casino_et-al_2019. This advancement has been commonly adopted for financial applications, with some of the most popular blockchain platform being Bitcoin and Ethereum @Corbet_et-al_2019. Although most notably known for its use in finance, blockchain has seen some use-cases in other domains @Tripathi_et-al_2023 including in the scientific world @Science_2017.

Current publication process has been subject to improvement primarily in areas regarding the openness of publication result and the credibility of the parties involved in the publication process. This has resulted in some movements we are slowly adopting today such as Open Access @Suber_2012 that aims to enable free publication results, ORCID @Masic_et-al_2016 that aims to provide credibility and recognition for researchers based on their published works, Open Peer Review @Ross-Hellauer_2017 which transformed the landscape of peer review process with transparent reviewing process, and more. These efforts however, are still hindered by central authorities and lack of transparency within publication processes. Based on the centralized and transparent nature of the process, blockchain has become a promising tool for publication process for its decentralized nature @Science_2017 @Bartling_Fecher_2016.

Transition to blockchain-based system however, poses new challenges in addition to designing a decentralized organization @Morales-Alarcón_et-al_2024 @Leible_et-al_2019. One such problem is the peer review process, which is the foundation of most modern publication process @Banks_2018 @Tennant_Ross-Hellauer_2020 @Wessely_1996. Designing an effective and transparent peer review process on blockchain-based publication system has been the subject of several studies. The proposed designs use smart contracts on the blockchain to provide incentives in the form of tokens @Tenorio-Fornés_et-al_2021 @Coelho_Brandão_2019 @Khan_Shahaab_2021 @Jan_2018.

Blockchain inherently provides a degree of anonymity by using public-private key cryptography. This scheme however only provides pseudonymity as transactions can be traced back through blockchain's immutable transaction records. This issue has been subject to studies that aim to increase its privacy and anonymity through cryptography and mixing schemes @Yang_et-al_2023 @de-Haro-Olmo_et-al_2020 @Glaeser_et-al_2022. The need for privacy and anonymity is also present in the blockchain-based peer review process. A study showed that participants of a blockchain-based publication system highlighted the need for anonymity in peer review process @Tenorio-Fornés_et-al_2021. Anonymity also helps in reducing social bias in reputation-based peer review process @Khan_Shahaab_2021. The case for anonymity in peer review process poses different challenges as peer review incentives are linked to the reviewers' identity - which can also be public, verified identity (similar to ORCID @Masic_et-al_2016) in some cases. This study aims to propose a method that preserves anonymity in general peer review incentive schemes on blockchain-based peer review system.
