The proposed solution is only in the form of sketch to protect the privacy of reviewers that provides review in a non-disclosed setting. This study does not explore further on other possibilities that might exhibit vulnerabilities. However, the proposed solution can be used as a starting point or as a sketch for blockchain-based peer review system that requires the reviewers to be anonymous. In some system, where the reviewers are given the right to review with _blind tokens_, the initial mixing approach to obfuscate the single-use identity link can be skipped, and the _blind token_ can be directly linked to the single-use identity. This however, does not achieve the same level of anonymity as the granter of the _blind tokens_ have the potential to link the reviewer's identity.
