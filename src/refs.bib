Peer-reviewers put their efforts in reviewing others research work voluntarily, without any expectations of incentives or rewards. The peer-review process has been criticized for its defects like slowness, bias and abuse of the process. In this paper, we present a model to address these issues by using the approach of recording peer-review data on the blockchain. By using the semantic web and linked data technologies, this system would be able to expose its data and interact with other systems. This system will be used to quantify, recognize and incentivize the peer-reviewing efforts by researchers.},

The study is carried out through a systematic literature review in different databases, obtaining in a first phase of selection 199 publications, of which 28 were selected for data extraction. The results obtained provide a strong relationship between privacy and anonymisation in most of the fields of application of blockchain, as well as a description of the techniques used for this purpose, such as Ring Signature, homomorphic encryption, k-anonymity or data obfuscation. Among the literature researched, some limitations and future lines of research on issues close to blockchain technology in the different fields of application can be detected. As conclusion, we extract the different degrees of application of privacy according to the mechanisms used and different techniques for the implementation of anonymisation, being one of the risks for privacy the traceability of the operations.},
